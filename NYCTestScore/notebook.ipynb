There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here..\nmean_avg_math = schools[\"average_math\"].mean()\nprint(mean_avg_math)\nr_above_80 = schools[\"average_math\"].quantile(0.8)\nprint(r_above_80)\nprint((800*80)/100)\nbest_math_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].query(\"average_math > 640\").sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\nprint(best_math_schools)\n\nschools.head()\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\ntop_10_schools = schools.groupby(\"school_name\", as_index=False)[\"total_SAT\"].mean().sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\n\nborough_stats = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].agg(['count', 'mean', 'std']).round(2)\nlargest_std_dev = borough_stats[borough_stats[\"std\"] == borough_stats[\"std\"].max()]\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={\"count\": \"num_schools\", \"mean\": \"average_SAT\", \"std\": \"std_SAT\"})\nprint(largest_std_dev)\n","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":53,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here..\nmean_avg_math = schools[\"average_math\"].mean()\nprint(mean_avg_math)\nr_above_80 = schools[\"average_math\"].quantile(0.8)\nprint(r_above_80)\nprint((800*80)/100)\nbest_math_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].query(\"average_math > 640\").sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\nprint(best_math_schools)\n\nschools.head()\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\ntop_10_schools = schools.groupby(\"school_name\", as_index=False)[\"total_SAT\"].mean().sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\n\nborough_stats = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].agg(['count', 'mean', 'std']).round(2)\nlargest_std_dev = borough_stats[borough_stats[\"std\"] == borough_stats[\"std\"].max()]\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={\"count\": \"num_schools\", \"mean\": \"average_SAT\", \"std\": \"std_SAT\"})\nprint(largest_std_dev)\n\n\n# Add as many cells as you like...","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1702919656816,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":374,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":213,"type":"dataFrame"}},"visualizeDataframe":false,"chartConfig":{"bar":{"hasRoundedCorners":true,"stacked":false},"type":"bar","version":"v1"}},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"432.944\n478.0\n640.0\n                                           school_name  average_math\n88                              Stuyvesant High School           754\n170                       Bronx High School of Science           714\n93                 Staten Island Technical High School           711\n365  Queens High School for the Sciences at York Co...           701\n68   High School for Mathematics, Science, and Engi...           683\n280                     Brooklyn Technical High School           682\n333                        Townsend Harris High School           680\n174  High School of American Studies at Lehman College           669\n0    New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...           657\n45                       Eleanor Roosevelt High School           641\n           num_schools  average_SAT  std_SAT\nborough                                     \nManhattan           89      1340.13   230.29\n"}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
